## 📌 Abstract

This project explores the evolving job market using data-driven insights and predictive modeling. We analyzed job trends, salary estimates, and company ratings using five machine learning algorithms. Our goal was to build a robust prediction system that could assist job seekers and recruiters alike.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Visualize salary trends, job roles, and industry insights.
- Identify patterns in hiring and geographic preferences.
- Compare performance of five ML algorithms:  
  Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.
- Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.
- Provide actionable insights to job seekers and employers.

## 🔍 Literature Survey

### Existing Systems:
- LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed
- Salary estimation tools
- HR analytics platforms

### Limitations:
- Often use a single algorithm
- Inaccurate user-generated data
- Poor transparency in recommendations
- Limited performance metrics beyond accuracy

## 🛠 Proposed System

### Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning:** Missing value handling, outlier removal, job title standardization.
- **EDA:** Salary distributions, company ratings, job types visualized using bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, and word clouds.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Applied and evaluated 5 ML models.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve.

### Highlights:
- **Random Forest achieved 98% accuracy.**
- All models scored over **93% accuracy.**
